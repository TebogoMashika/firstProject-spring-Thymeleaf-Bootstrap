Constructor dependency injection call within the controller class

- class which is a controller has an attributes Owner service (interface)
- the attribute is injected inside the controller meaning that the interface (Owner service) will be called first along with the methods when the class is called
- from this we can use the methods inside the controller to perform functions
- the methods call POJO's of
